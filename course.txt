There is only an oral exam and no written exam (as for all my courses). You don't need to sign up in Ladok for an oral exam.

You can take the exam as soon as you have done all labs. Sign up here: https://calendly.com/forsete/office-hours

There are slots from now until the day before midsummer. If you fail, you can retake the it after at least one week (if there are slots available).

You can book a time slot also for asking me questions. You can ask as much as you want and there is no upper limit. My goal, obviously, is that 100 % will pass the course with good grades.

In the exam, you are allowed to bring one book plus 8 A4 pages (hand written or printed from pdf).

Have fun,
