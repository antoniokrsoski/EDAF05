  \section{Results}

  \todo[inline]{Briefly comment the results, did the script say all your solutions were correct? Approximately how long time does it take for the program to run on the largest input? What takes the majority of the time?}
  About 12 seconds, all tests passed. 

  \section{Implementation details}

  \todo[inline]{How did you implement the solution? Which data structures were used? Which modifications to these data structures were used? What is the overall running time? Why?}
  Implemented using Prim's algorithm with the help of a min heap, a visited set and an adjacency list. Overall running time is n^2 log n, n^2 because in worst case we add duplicates to the heap that we already popped earlier, and log n for heapify.
